Welcome to my website! I am **Professor of Cultural Evolution** in the [Human Behaviour and Cultural Evolution Group](https://hubceg.jimdofree.com/) at the University of Exeterâ€™s Cornwall Campus, UK.

I study **cultural evolution**, the idea that cultural change constitutes a Darwinian evolutionary process that can be studied using similar tools, methods and concepts as those used by biologists to study genetic evolution.

I use **experiments** to simulate human cultural evolution in the lab. In these experiments people typically make and copy technological artifacts such as arrowheads or handaxes, or solve problems that resemble real-world challenges. The aim is to use simple experiments to better understand how psychological and social processes may have shaped real-life cultural change, past and present. 

I also construct **models and simulations** of cultural evolution. These explore how individual decisions (e.g. when and from whom people learn) translate into population-level patterns of cultural change.

Finally, I analyse **big datasets** to explain large-scale, long-term patterns of cultural evolution in the real world.
