abstract = "In this introductory chapter, we first provide some background on the two major recurrent themes of the volume, i.e. learning strategies of individuals, and social and demographic characteristics of populations. This is followed by a brief summary of each chapter. Then, we conclude with some thoughts on why and how the methods and findings presented in this volume are relevant to, and might inform our understanding of, the replacement of Neanderthals by modern humans (Homo sapiens)."
